FlutterGram is a mobile application built with Flutter that aims to replicate the functionality and design of Instagram. This project focuses on implementing login/signup functionality and integrating Firebase as a database to store user data, posts, and other content.

## Features Implemented

- **Basic Frontend**: The basic frontend of the application has been developed, including UI screens for viewing feeds, user profiles, etc.


## Planned Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement login/signup functionality using Firebase Authentication SDK.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore to store user data, posts, comments, etc.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to update their profile information and view their own posts.
- **Authorization & Security**: Implement security rules to control access to Firebase resources.
